  # Repositories are intentionally included at the flux/meta level to avoid
  # duplicate resource IDs when building subsets of the repo (for example
  # when individual app kustomizations include this component). Do not add
  # `./repos` here to prevent OCIRepository resources (like `app-template`)
  # from appearing multiple times in the same build.
